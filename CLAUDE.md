## Project Overview

This is a multi-module project for document processing and benchmark dataset generation.

## Usage
This is a uv project. Use `uv run` for executing Python scripts.

## Development Strategy
* Use Python 3.12 features and syntax, including the new built-in types (e.g., `list[str]`, `dict[str, int]`).
* When using visual separators in code, prefer this format: `# ========== SECTION NAME ==========`
* KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Simplicity should be a key goal in design. Choose straightforward solutions over complex ones whenever possible. Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and debug.
