## Synthetic PDF Generator Module

This module generates HTML documents with mathematical formulas and text content using configurable styling, then converts them to PDFs using Playwright and Chromium. The primary use case is generating diverse document layouts for PDF parsing benchmarks.

The tool uses MathJax for LaTeX formula rendering and includes intelligent content fitting to ensure single-page PDF output.
